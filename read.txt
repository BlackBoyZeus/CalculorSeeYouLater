the provided code integrates the initial futuristic, holographic design of the calculator with the Batcave-style movements using keyframe animations.

Here's a summary of the styles and animations:

Base Design:
Dark, radial-gradient background to give depth.
The calculator has a semi-transparent, blurry backdrop and a cyan glow, giving it a holographic feel.
Buttons and input fields have transparent backgrounds, cyan borders, and shadows to match the overall theme.
Animations:
Pulse: Buttons gently pulse when hovered, giving a feeling of interactivity.
Fly-in: The calculator appears to assemble itself from below on load.
Type-in: History items appear one after the other as if they're being typed.
Scan: The display has a scanning effect, simulating a scan line moving horizontally.
Hover Effect: The entire screen slightly moves up and down, giving an illusion that the calculator is hovering in the air.
This combined style and animation approach gives the calculator a high-tech, Batman Batcave aesthetic. If you integrate this CSS with the provided HTML, you should be able to see these effects in action.

For even more immersion, you could consider adding sound effects or further visual effects using JavaScript libraries or WebGL.
